# NYC_high_school_survey_data
Data cleaning, visualization, and analysis of NYC high school demographic and academic data.

This Jupyter notebook was created through the Data Science in Python course on Dataquest.

In this project, I cleaned and combined several diverse datasets. Then I investigated associations between demographics (sex, ethnicity) and academic performance (SAT scores, AP exam scores).
